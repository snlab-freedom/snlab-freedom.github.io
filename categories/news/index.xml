      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SNLab organized the workshop in May 5-6&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;;font-size: 16px;vertical-align: super&#34;&gt;th&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, 2016. This workshop bring together experts from software-defined networking, wireless/hybrid networks, tactical networks, high-performance computing and related disciplines to investigate both the benefits and the issues when applying SDN to army applications. The emergence of SDN, whose key features include separation between the data-plane and the control-plane of networks, and logically centralized network control, has potential to completely reshape the field of computer networking. Going beyond conceptual models, the existing deployment of SDN in major data centers (e.g., Google and Microsoft data centers) has demonstrated the substantial gain and flexibility of SDN. However, the existing initiatives of SDN focus mostly on non-tactical data center networks, service provider networks, and enterprise networks. Given the substantial potential of SDN, it is imperative that we develop a better understanding of both the impacts and the potential issues of applying SDN to Army Applications, primarily for multi-hop wireless/hybrid networks, but also for high performance computing in the army context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We invited some famous professors and scientists to discuss some SDN challenge problem, including Yale, UCLA, Imperial College, University of Pennsylvania, Caltech, Carnegie Mellon University, Princeton University, MIT, DARPA, IBM, Uber etc. famous university and company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Y. Richard Yang as a chair , made a key note speech. And he introduced some recently research. A key benefit of SDN is logically centralized control. There is a large body of existing work of SDN control path, but they are mostly in the context of wired networks such as data center networks and wide-area networks (WAN). By control path, we mean the complete spectrum from controller placement, controller fault tolerance, controller programming, and controller-forwarding elements integration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This workshop reviewed key related work and warmly discussed issues with potential outcomes. The workshop successful hold and all of attendees are very satisfied with the outcome of the workshop.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SNLab members (Hu Ning, Du Haizhou, Xiang Qiao, Pen Dan) recently attended the NSF Algorithms in the Field (AiTF) Workshop on Algorithms for Software-Defined Networking in June 2-3, 2016. This workshop is sponsored by the Algorithms in the Field (AiTF) program of the National Science Foundation and the DIMACS(Center for Discrete Mathematics &amp;amp; Theroetical Computer Science Technology Center). Including UC Berkeley, Stanford, Carnegie Mellon University, Princeton University, MIT, Google, Microsoft attended the workshop, and discuss together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers working at the intersection of the theory and practice of networking, with a special focus on the applicability of these ideas to SDN, in the hope of jumpstarting collaborations between theoreticians and networking researchers in this area. This provide not only an opportunity for the networking community to get new ideas and approaches, but will also provide a tremendous opportunity for the theoretical community, both as a source of new algorithmic problems and as a way to have a direct impact. This is to some extent in contrast to the traditional networking paradigm, where the algorithmic problems often do not have a path to deployment as they are constrained by existing protocols.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xiang Qiao, represented the SNLab made a speech about Magellan: Toward Automatic Multi-Table SDN Programming. He systematic tell that Multi-table pipelining has emerged as a key technique for the next-generation SDN data path. Programming such a data path model, however, can be challenging. In this talk, he also discusses several algorithmic challenges in programming multi-table pipelines. This talk attracted both academic and industrial researchers. They gave some good suggestion and comments to us. And most of them highly agree with our research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As this workshop, we discussed with the workshop attendees on the most important algorithmic problems involving SDN. This serves as a central point of reference for future work in algorithms for SDN, and hopefully spur further research in the way that lists of open problems have led to further research in other parts of algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;June 1 to 2, 2016, “Global SDNFV Tech Conference 2016” has been grandly held in Beijing. Prof. Yang and SNLab members are invited to participate in this conference. Prof. Yang made a speech entitled “*SDN programming automation: abstraction, tools, and implementations*”. In this talk, Prof.Yang explained the goal of SNLab, cache and acceleration automation, and present some prototypes of our projects, which include &lt;em&gt;Magellan&lt;/em&gt;, automatic generation of multi-level flow tables, &lt;em&gt;Maple&lt;/em&gt;, using TraceTree to change high level algorithm policies into the low level flow entries, and &lt;em&gt;FAST&lt;/em&gt;, automatic re-execution function instances to make sure the correctness of user functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2016 Internet2 Global Summit&lt;/em&gt; was successfully held in Chicago, Illinois on May 15 to May 18.The Internet2 Global Summit is a leading forum to support and drive the advancement of research and education, spur next-generation innovation and accelerate global discovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SNlab cooperated with CERN from Caltech on the discussion and demonstration of latest achievements among this summit. Core members including Jensen Zhang, Mingming Chen, Qiao Xiang, Kai Gao, May Wang and Shawn Lin attended the summit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Achievements on development of ALTO SPCE was presented and received great acclaim from attendees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://snlab-freedom.github.io/images/posts/2016-05-31-demonstration-of-alto-spec-on-2016-internet2-global-summit-1.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SNlab&amp;rsquo;s major work is based on the SDN controller OpenDaylight. This demonstration is bulit on the environment provided by Caltech, with several Pica8 and SDN switches(from Dell) and work with standard protocol OpenFlow to connect OpenDaylight. The convertion from virtual environment to the real is a great breakthrough .&lt;/p&gt;

Postdoc Positions at SNLab at Tongji-Yale Center of Advanced Networks and Networked Systems

Founded by Professor Y. Richard Yang <http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/yry/> in the summer of 2014, and hosted in the Institute of Advanced Studies at Tongji University, the Systems Networking Lab (SNLab) will provide astimulating, world-class environment for the advancement of both theory and systems of networks and networked systems.

With continued development and wide deployment of advanced, transformative networks and systems techniques, such as software defined networks, Internet of things, 5G networks, mobile networks, network function virtualization, and Cloud computing, networks and networked systems remain an exciting, dynamic field that new ideas continue to emerge and new systems continue to be developed and deployed.

Dr. Y. Richard Yang is a Professor of Computer Science at Yale, where he founded and leads the Laboratory of Networked Systems (LANS). He is also a professor at Tongji University, where he leads the SNLab. Prof. Yang's current research focus is on new computer network architectures, SDN programming, content distribution networks, and network-application interactions. He has published more than 10 papers in ACM SIGCOMM, the flagship conference on networking; among which 4 were nominated as best papers. His team proposed the framework of P4P for network-application interactions, which is adopted by IETF by forming the ALTO Working Group, which has defined the ALTO Protocol. His work has been implemented/adopted in products/systems of major companies (e.g., AT&T, Alcatel-Lucent, Cisco, Microsoft, PPLive, Youku), and featured in mainstream media including Economist, Forbes, Guardian, Chronicle of Higher Education, Information Week, MIT Technology Review, Science Daily, USA Today, Washington Post, and Wired, among others. His awards include a CAREER Award from the National Science Foundation and a Schlumberger Foundation Award. Dr. Yang's received his B.E. degree in Computer Science and Technology from Tsinghua University (1993), and his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Computer Science from the University of Texas at Austin (1998 and 2001).
